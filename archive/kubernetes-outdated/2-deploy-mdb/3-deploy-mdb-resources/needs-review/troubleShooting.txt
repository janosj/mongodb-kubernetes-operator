To get the current status (add “-o yaml” for more info):

  kubectl get mdb jj-replica-set -n mongodb -w

The -w flag is a watch flag that automatically refreshes until it achieves Running state.

If the deployed resource seems stuck in “Reconciling”, try:

  kubectl logs -f deployment/mongodb-enterprise-operator -n mongodb
