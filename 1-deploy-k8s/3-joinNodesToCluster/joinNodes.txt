This command comes from the previous output of the kubeadm init command.

It looks something like this:

kubeadm join 172.31.54.234:6443 --token os1h03.5s0bbq3p9rx7xq8l \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:6ed4d9127452fede68489e4a8827fc59d5cd38c1bbbbf6c7a65a2c543618a532

Run as root.

If you donâ€™t have the token, you can retrieve it from the control-plane node.
If the token has expired (default is 24 hours) you can generate a new one.
